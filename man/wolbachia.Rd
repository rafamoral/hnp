\code{treat}\tab a factor with levels \code{m+f+}, \code{m+f-}, \code{f+}, \code{m-f-} and \code{f-},\cr
\tab where \code{m} stands for male, \code{f} stands for female, \code{+} means infected and \code{-} means non-infected;\cr
\tab \code{f+} and \code{f-} represent virgin infected and non-infected females, respectively.

\details{
The bacteria \emph{Wolbachia} is commonly found in various insect
species and has the ability to change reproductive aspects of its
host. When it infects the wasp \emph{Trichogramma galloi} it is known to induce
thelythokous parthenogenesis, i.e., only females are produced from
unfertilized eggs. Souza (2011) conducted
an experiment to assess the effects of \emph{Wolbachia} on the
viability of \emph{T. galloi} eggs. Around 100 \emph{Diatraea saccharalis}
eggs (the host) were offered to infected (+) or non-infected (-)
parasitoid couples or virgin females every day until the death of
the female. The parasitised eggs, easily identifiable
because they become dark, were then kept on moist filter paper for
twenty days when counts were then made of the number of
eggs that had an orifice, which meant that an adult parasitoid had
emerged and thus the parasitoid was viable.
