### Half-Normal Plots with Simulated Envelopes

Package includes two functions, **hnp** and **plot.hnp**, as well as seven data sets extracted from Demétrio et al (2014).
Explanation on how to produce the half-normal plots with simulation envelopes can be found in Demétrio and Hinde (1997) and on the hnp function documentation.
Data sets are based on entomology studies and the focus is on overdispersed data. Details on overdispersion models can be found in Hinde and Demétrio (1998).
